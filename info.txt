Today I learned the basics of Git, which is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code. Here are some key points:

- `git add` stages files to be committed.
- `git commit` saves a snapshot of the staged changes.
- `git push` uploads the committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.
- Git helps developers collaborate more efficiently and manage different versions of their code.
